# SenpaiDetector

*Please ignore this repository. It is useless and dull*


SenpaiDetector is a kludgy debugging tool used for testing the ScatterRoutingService ([this thingy](https://github.com/Scatterbrain-DTN/ScatterRoutingService)) in the field. It does not do anything that anyone would consider a benefit to society. Look elsewhere for a productive use of your comcast datacap.
